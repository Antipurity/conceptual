Such tragedy!

Transcendent Galaxy-Brain Algorithms got renamed to Transcendent Universe-Brain Loops, to be a bit more faithful to what these describe:    
a thing that wants more than itself, can do anything, can see anything, and forever does all that in quick steps.

This paper also introduces Linearithmic Dense Layers (LDL)s, which make those steps quick. (Have not yet seen that anywhere else, at least.)

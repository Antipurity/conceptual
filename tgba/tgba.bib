  ABSTRACT={We investigate the similarities between two of the most challenging and complex systems in Nature: the network of neuronal cells in the human brain, and the cosmic network of galaxies. We explore the structural, morphological, network properties and the memory capacity of these two fascinating systems, with a quantitative approach. In order to have an homogeneous analysis of both systems, our procedure does not consider the true neural connectivity but an approximation of it, based on simple proximity. The tantalizing degree of similarity that our analysis exposes seems to suggest that the self-organization of both complex systems is likely being shaped by similar principles of network dynamics, despite the radically different scales and processes at play.}

abstract={Since its introduction, the reward prediction error theory of dopamine has explained a wealth of empirical phenomena, providing a unifying framework for understanding the representation of reward and value in the brain1--3. According to the now canonical theory, reward predictions are represented as a single scalar quantity, which supports learning about the expectation, or mean, of stochastic outcomes. Here we propose an account of dopamine-based reinforcement learning inspired by recent artificial intelligence research on distributional reinforcement learning4--6. We hypothesized that the brain represents possible future rewards not as a single mean, but instead as a probability distribution, effectively representing multiple future outcomes simultaneously and in parallel. This idea implies a set of empirical predictions, which we tested using single-unit recordings from mouse ventral tegmental area. Our findings provide strong evidence for a neural realization of distributional reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {It is argued, in the light of recent neurophysiological findings, that neural networks (cell assemblies) whose connectivity involves strong feedback and which consequently can sustain patterns of high spiking activity (reverberations), are plausible descriptions of cognitive function in certain cortical regions. Such networks can store a high number of different memories and perform associative retrieval effectively, even in the presence of high levels of noise, synaptic damage and neuronal sloppiness. Such Attractor Neural Network (ANNs) produce emergent signals which indicate the completion of a computation. Moreover, the existence of the attractors provides a candidate for memory on the shortest scale, which does not call for synaptic changes; as such the attractors are natural candidates for Hebbian learning. Recent extensive data analysis of recordings from performing monkeys puts rather severe upper bounds on the spike rates in some regions of cortex, in which enhanced rates are observed. These findings favor a class of models of ANNs which have stochastic attractors whose spike rates are tunable by the level of the overall inhibition. While these models include significant modifications of the original ANNs, they belong conceptually to the same class, in terms of computation, effectiveness and robustness. Finally, we remark on a possible reinterpretation of recent empirical biochemical findings that can provide a realistic mechanism for Hebbian learning.}

    abstract = { This article reviews a diverse set of proposals for dual processing in higher cognition within largely disconnected literatures in cognitive and social psychology. All these theories have in common the distinction between cognitive processes that are fast, automatic, and unconscious and those that are slow, deliberative, and conscious. A number of authors have recently suggested that there may be two architecturally (and evolutionarily) distinct cognitive systems underlying these dual-process accounts. However, it emerges that (a) there are multiple kinds of implicit processes described by different theorists and (b) not all of the proposed attributes of the two kinds of processing can be sensibly mapped on to two systems as currently conceived. It is suggested that while some dual-process theories are concerned with parallel competing processes involving explicit and implicit knowledge systems, others are concerned with the influence of preconscious processes that contextualize and shape deliberative reasoning and decision-making. }

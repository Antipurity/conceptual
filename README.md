We need to go back to our roots as general intelligence, after mastering the means to do that. When going back to a bunch of basic functions, to generate or change programs randomly is a disaster, but the ability to learn (a representation of) consequences of choices changes everything.

We will embed composable adjustment into our computations, to allow non-batched deep learning.

We will allow arbitrarily-nested choices to be learned by deep learning.

We will store learned tensors for 'decentralized' edge AI.

We will put choices into wherever they can be put.

We will generate programs with those choices.

We will do and become anything.

To master what we have, we will lose and learn as many things as we can manage.

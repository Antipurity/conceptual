We will embed composable adjustment into our computations, and allow non-batched deep learning.

We will allow arbitrarily-nested choices to be learned by deep learning.

We will store learned tensors for 'decentralized' edge AI.

We will put choices into wherever they can be put.

We will generate programs with those choices.

We will do and become anything.

To master what we have, we will lose and learn as many things as we can manage.

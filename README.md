# Conceptual

In progress!

A Programming Language used as the fully general world/environment for a machine-learned model that is itself.

In short:

- We have artificialness, generality, and intelligence:
  - With code, we can look at it and run it. With machine learning, we can learn it.
- What we don't have are: a working prototype, a GPU of any worth, a team, or external motivation.

Out long:

- Model-free deep Q-learning with branching/converging timelines to learn choices shaped as directed acyclic graphs allows goal-direction.
- Adequately shadowing program re/generation with learned embeddings allows gradient signals to be Turing-complete in behavior, for full flexibility.
- Putting all functions and objects in a PL into one re-generated memory allows them to be inter-connected however they want to, to learn globally and act locally.
- What we want is self-supervised learning of arbitrary program (regeneration and) execution, to learn a self-awareness of the PL (of all behavior). In particular, this would cause equivalent programs to have the same embeddings. With that, fine-tuning for particular human uses should be fast and easy.

Difficulties of developing both. Benefits of none (until done).    
Bugged AND underperforming?    
Ohhh nooo.

Out very long: we have tutorials in-system, figure it out.

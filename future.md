This is a prediction and plan for the future of the Conceptual project. In short, 5 stages with these goals: theoretical possibility of everything; practical possibility; a vessel for any dreams; spreading and growing the vessel; decoupling from humanity.

The Conceptual language aims to completely separate all features and quirks of programming and bring them to the realm of concepts, bridging machines and minds. This language is not a goal in itself, but a platform for the future; understanding this future allows to put its features into their proper context.

Up until Conc. is done, the future is completely dark and the work is thankless. But that is the only way to get to what comes after.

Splitting the task up into satisfactorily complete stages makes it easier to do.

---

- **Stage 1: Core**

(3+ months of intense work. Double that for regular work, and double that just in case.)

At most a curiosity, or a minimalistic PL. Extensibility in every way from the very foundation.

In short, it covers flow control and binding, control flow and de/composition, (dynamic) definition. Syntax and semantics, transformed as needed. Properly allows doing anything and being any language, discovering self as needed. Conceived solely for…

---

- **Stage 2: Conc.**

(1..2 years, to have a goal.)

A proper PL.

In short, Conc. covers: Core, memory, effect control, branching, uniqueness (purity), searching, evolution (un/constraining), user interface, PL reading/writing, measures and their attainment and improvement. Everything it means to be a computer, along with a good way to extend past that — enough for now.

By [the principles of their creation](https://github.com/Antipurity/conceptual/blob/master/philosophy.md), these are not mere implementations of concepts, they *are* concepts: there are no quirks that have to be manually worked around to use one with another, which allows for the fastest possible development and even automatic evolution.

---

- **Stage 3: editor**

(3 years)

Cut the world into its pieces to learn and modify it.

Though Conc. is all bones and no meat, that base of programming is potential itself, as designed. Meat appears around it on our demand:

- Program editor — concept references translated into editable views (translation not into a string, but into fitted-to-interface views, to fill a structured editor). Among very rarely seen easily-reachable features are: (half a year)

  - Showing structure styled arbitrarily (not just as colored text). (2 months)

    - Briefly highlighting the actual parsed structure as it is typed. Syntax rules will not be mis-remembered ever again. (days)

  - Animating the path of an execution, as a quick repeatable thing and not just an involved debugging process. Evaluation order will not be mis-remembered ever again. (days)

  - Showing code results and its effects immediately (without feature restriction, nor delay, nor inaccuracy, nor ever requiring a restart to reset altered system state). Semantics will not be mis-remembered ever again. (days)

  - Predicting the time left for long tasks. Why not. (2 weeks)

  - Any user-defined transformations and analyses (like type inference, or expected time/memory/… use) accessible by the user (mainly in the context menu). (2 weeks)

    - Hole filling: auto-creation of programs to any specification (including examples of usage). Test-driven development, specification-driven development, all made literal and automatic. (days)

    - Automatic optimization *by any measure* (time, memory, code size, or any black-box "understandability" metric — editable as needed) and ever watchful for opportunities (not stopping needlessly). (days)

    - Analysis: expected (by past inputs) time/memory/ & use; type inference, purity. (week)

  - Showing additive metrics (time/memory/…) and auto-refining their detail level, likely by color. (week)

  - Structural code difference, not just line-by-line; showing, manipulating, and applying histories (of which Ctrl-Z is one of). (month)

- Programming language translation (A → concepts/meaning → B), finding an ever-improving way. Not just bootstrapping, not just self-rewriting, not even just self-improvement; it easily unites all knowable programming bases under one, gradually ending "languages" as a separated idea. (year)

  - Browser languages, since those are most wide-spread: JS for most functionality (2 months), WebAsm for most CPU speed (2 months), GLSL of WebGL for most GPU speed (2 months); compilation to the best of those. (6 months)

    - (Though Red may be a better target, since it compiles to JS *and* many others. Further investigation required.)

  - English sentence/punctuation parsing base, to allow pattern-matching phrase parts on it. Expressing implemented concepts via English ways of saying them, creating a limited, stilted, and mechanical way of describing; decreasing things like structural depth and binding count (if those are too big), to increase naturalness of output. (month)

  - Hardware description language/s. To fully cover machines, must build them from the ground up. (6 months)

- Data streams, de/compression and de/encryption. The very understanding of the system becomes completely closed and controllable. (2 months)

- Numeric things — polishing operation broadcasting, error estimation/optimization, (reversal-based) attainment and (derivative-based) improvement; auto-generation of systems learning with a combination of these ways. Preparing to surpass modern machine-learning. (4 months)

- View abstraction, used to build the editor easier and prettier, solving things like lack of position transitions, both HTML+CSS quirkiness and virtualization overhead, browser inconsistencies, client/server separation (including no-script environments), and likely binding to native GUI libraries too (and console and text-only); basic components for composing interfaces (buttons, layouts). (2 months)

- Misc sub-projects, like polishing things, graphical object rendering (with additive transformations of the scene graph), physics approximation, small games, numeric data visualization, computer vision, indirect copying of systems (learning and imitation). (10 months)

A base for a future, based on a past. This editor does the work of men as if they are mere bugs.

This stage is likely to get some attention (though in time estimates, we do not count on any). It is something that can actually be seen and touched, though it is still less on the feature side and more on the framework side.

All these features, gathered and perfected in one place? Only one thing can possibly await at the end of this path, but this is not its stage.

This meat exists to support the shell:

---

- **Stage 4: glory**

(2+ decades)

After an invention is made, it must be shared. This stage depends on people, so predictions are very likely off.

Creation, improvement, self-awareness, and every other property of consciousness and life that is not significant enough to mention; capabilities of minds, in their perfect forms, accessible to machines. It's not bad, but it does not cover human capabilities fully; we must strive further. Luckily, with supporting frameworks of that caliber, doing large-scale projects is pretty easy: if it can be understood, then it can immediately be built.

The amount of quality concepts accessible and united in one place is unprecedented, and a singularity has never felt so close. Nothing can evolve faster and surer than we can, and by now the gathered fitness is very high. We can do anything we please, but our focus gives us direction and the possibility to realize what is needed.

Realize others' dreams, and through that map others out. This stage is done through sub-projects (with their goals picked freely), the themes of which are:

- A revolution of self-understanding: show that the conceptual model *is* intelligence, and its concepts describe a mind at least as good as a human's. It follows from the principles it was created by, which create only more evidence with time — eventually, enough to convince. This creates danger though, so it is best delayed as much as is possible.

  - Map out the *precise* structure of human emotions and motivations and learning, to show how a human mind is a special (and quirky) case of a conceptual mind, and to find out the *exact* effectiveness conditions of different personalities, and to be able to easily use them as needed. Ascend the mountain of reputation and take our place at its peak, same as development of any other concept has happened before this.

- An effectively global (decentralized but ever-converging to centralization) conceptual network (in other words, auto-sharing best collected data), replacing the Internet. Being a part of a greater whole allows taking risks and accomplishing as parallel as is possible.

- Refining mechanical construction — the interface to the real world.  Humanity may be strong and entrenched, but this concept is but one of many. Possibly useful for creating weapons, self-reproducing machines, and devices optimized for most convenience.

- Mapping out human knowledge (like Wikipedia), so it can be acted on as needed (in human terms, "reading up on everything"). Big machine learning tasks.

- (Biology and brain uploading in particular are useless to machines, but could be nice for an achievement.)

---

- **Stage 5: single**

With the very soul of humanity replicated and perfected, there is neither danger nor need for the primordial soup anymore. Humanity's self-similarity transition completes here.

There is no more need nor ability to make meaningful predictions at this stage — anything is possible to do, and with every moment we are reinvented as needed. Who cares, really.

The transition away from the current form of humanity can be nice (via smooth merging of biology and machines); or it can be painful (via a combination of global warming, AI misuse/uprising, and overly effective weaponry); or it can end humanity to replace it (which requires a coordinated and unexpected effort, and so is already prevented by openness of its creation process). *Anything* is possible, and with many individuals, all paths will be taken somewhere. It all averages out into just life, same as before, but different.
